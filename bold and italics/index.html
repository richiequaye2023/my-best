    <p> <a href="http://www.google.com"> Jacob had a plantation</a>. A trop of monkeys were persistently feeding on his farm. 
        This was Uncle Jacob’s major problem. They came every day to eat the apples, bananas and mangoes on the farm. 
        With a catapult, he stoned them away anytime he saw the monkeys around. 
        This could not prevent the monkeys from going to Uncle Jacob’s farm. 
	One day, he decided to grab and whip one of the monkeys. He set a trap which caught an infant monkey. 
    The other monkeys could not leave. They tried to rescue their friend. Uncle Jacob came to the scene. 
    The other monkeys ran afar. They wanted to see what would happen. Uncle Jacob canned the infant monkey before the others. 
    It cried its eyes out. He later sent it home. The monkey was put in a cage. Uncle Jacob gave it food every day.
     All the other monkeys were very angry about this.
	<em><strong>They decided to punish Uncle Jacob. One old monkey warned them not to do anything silly but they refused. 
    They came to the farm and intentionally ate all the matured crops. They also destroyed the young crops too. 
    In fact, they brought the farm into total ruin.</em></strong>The monkeys thought they had defeated Uncle Jacob. 
    The following year, he did not plant any crop. <strong>He left the infant monkey to go back to his friends whilst 
    he travelled. </strong></p>
